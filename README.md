# Monotreme

Monotreme is a light way to read in, edit, and write data to files at an address you choose (local drive or on a web server).

Local save currently uses Internet Explorer 11's ActiveX controls (yikes!). Remote save is coming and is planned to use WebDAV.

It's called Monotreme because WebDAV is old and a bit 'against the grain' of common webdev practice.
